# FERS
Facial Expression Recognition System
In this project, I tried to develop a computer vision system to classify facial expressions from images captured in the wild accurately. The model is trained on the ExpW dataset, which consists of images labeled with one of seven emotional categories. We will implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and evaluate its performance using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59801fc7-913b-48f3-a05e-8f986a357ffc)
